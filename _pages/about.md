I am a third-year PhD student at the Language Technologies Institute within Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, advised by [Mona Diab](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html) and [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/). I am also currently interning at Meta FAIR, working with [Ruta Desai](https://rutadesai.github.io). My research is supported by the [NSF Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program).

I'm broadly interested in value alignment and human-AI interaction, especially in the context of language models. Some specific subquestions I’m currently interested in include:
* How can we steer language models toward more fine-grained alignment targets?
* What are the best ways to train agents to collaborate with users and task partners?
* How can we effectively oversee real-world interactions between many LLM agents?

Please reach out (email is best) if you’re interested in my work or in collaborating!

Outside of research, I enjoy running, bouldering, and writing.
