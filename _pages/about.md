## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student at the Language Technologies Institute within Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, advised by [Mona Diab](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html) and [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/). Before joining LTI, I graduated with a B.S. in Math and Computer Science from Harvey Mudd College, where I worked with [Calden Wloka](https://www.caldenwloka.com/) and [Heather Zinn Brooks](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/hzinnbrooks).

I’m broadly interested in evaluations, social intelligence, and value pluralism, especially as they relate to language models. Some specific subquestions I’m currently interested in include:

* How can we evaluate and improve language models in more interactive settings?
* How can we better control language agents' behavior according to the preferences of diverse principals?
* How can we best evaluate social intelligence and theory of mind in language technologies?

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in my work or in collaborating!
